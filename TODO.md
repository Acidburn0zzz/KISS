### Things I need to do before deploying my new website:
- signup to google analytics;
- modify verification meta tag;
- validate URL for twitter: https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator;
- add and stylize **Spread the word** at the posts footer;
- decide how Projects section will look like;
- remove what is specific to my page (especially in page-projects);
