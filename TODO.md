### Things I need to do before deploying my new website:
- signup to google analytics;
- modify verification meta tag;
- validate URL for twitter: https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator;
- add and stylize **Spread the word** at the posts footer;
- remove what is specific to my page (especially in page-projects);
- add tag.hbs;
- add favicon;
- maybe in the future (not of utmost importance) add pagination.hbs;
